Note that one of the differences between input & textarea
elements is that 
    - input doesn't need a closing tag
        <input type="text" />
    - but textarea has a closing tag   
        <textarea> </textarea>

Another difference when we want to set default value for them
    - input has an attribute called value in which we can add the default value
    - but textarea takes the default value between its openning & closing tags.



-----------------------------------------------

The default value for button is type="submit"

-----------------------------------------------

On of the importance of using the same id in input & for in label
is the label is clickable
If there is a radio button, and you want to check the second item
Instead of clicking the small are of the button,
You can click on the associated label to choose this option.
