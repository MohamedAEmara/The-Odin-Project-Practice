        <!--  
            The form element accepts two essential attributes; 
            
            the first is the action attribute which takes a URL value 
            that tells the form where it should send its data to be processed.
            
            The second is the method attribute which tells the browser which HTTP request 
            method it should use to submit the form. 
            The GET and POST request methods are the two you will find yourself using the most.
        -->

        <!--  
            We use GET when we want to retrieve something from a server.
            For example, Google uses a GET request when you search as it gets the search results.
        -->

        <!-- 
            POST is used when we want to change something on the server, 
            for example, when a user makes an account or makes a payment on a website.
         -->
        <form action="example.com/path" method="post">
            <!-- type ===> tells the broswer what type of data it should render -->
            <input type="text">
            <!-- 
                Text inputs accept any text input. For example, you would use it to 
                collect things like users’ first and last names. 
            -->

            <!-- To create a label, we use the <label> element. The text 
                we want displayed in the label will go between its opening and closing tags: -->
            <label for="first_name">First Name:</label>
            <!--  
                Labels accept a for attribute, which associates it with a particular input. 
                The input we want to associate with a label needs an id attribute with 
                the same value as the label’s for attribute.
            -->

            <!-- To guide users on what to enter in form elements, we can include placeholder text in input fields. -->
            <!-- this is done by adding placeholder attribute to an input  -->

            <!-- Use placeholder text to demonstrate how text should be entered and formatted. -->

                The name attribute serves as a reference to the data inputted into a form control after submitting it. 
                You can think of it as a variable name for the input. 
                Form input should always have a name attribute; otherwise, it will be ignored when the form is submitted.

            -->
            <input type="text" id="first_name" name="first_name">

            <!--  
                They differ from regular text inputs in that they mask the inputted data with another character 
                usually an asterisk (*) or bullet point (•) – to prevent anyone from seeing what has been entered.
            -->
            <label for="user_password">Password:</label>
            <input type="password" id="user_password" name="password">

                To collect dates from a user, we can use a date input. 
                This input is unique because it provides a better user experience 
                for choosing dates by rendering a simple date picker calendar.

            <!-- ==================== Text Area ====================== -->
            <!-- 
                the text area element provides an input box that can accept text 
                that spans multiple lines like user comments and reviews. 
                It can also be resized by clicking and dragging the bottom right corner 
                to make it bigger or smaller.
