It's a central repository of configuration for tools, 
it's where npm and yarn store the names and version for all 
the installed packages.
It respects the JSON format



"name": "test-project"
It defines a name property, which tells the name of the app, or package, 
that's contained in the same folder where this file lives.

there are lots of things going on here:

    version         =>      indicates the current version
    name            =>      sets the application/package name
    description     =>      is a brief description of the app/package
    main            =>      sets the entry point for the application
    private         =>      if set to true prevents the app/package to be accidentally published on npm
    scripts         =>      defines a set of node scripts you can run
    dependencies    =>      sets a list of npm packages installed as dependencies
    devDependencies =>      sets a list of npm packages installed as development dependencies
    engines         =>      sets which versions of Node.js this package/app works on
    browserslist    =>      is used to tell which browsers (and their versions) you want to support
