async       ---->       tells the js that we declared a promise function
                        js automatically returns a promise 
                            - returning a value means "succeed" or "resolve" the promise
                            - getting an error means "failure" or "reject" the promise



await       ---->       tells the js to wait till a async action to finish before continuing the function
                        It's like "Pause until done"

// We can have "async" without "await"
// But, can't have "await" without "async"
